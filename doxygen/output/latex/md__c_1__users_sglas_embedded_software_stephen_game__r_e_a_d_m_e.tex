Terminal-\/based Asteroids game for embedded platforms

This project recreates the classic Asteroids game in a terminal application (e.\+g Pu\+T\+TY, Tera\+Term) over U\+A\+RT protocol. This uses \href{https://github.com/muhlbaier/embedded-software}{\texttt{ embedded-\/software library}} for U\+A\+RT abstraction, terminal functions, and task management systems. Therefore, this project can be run on any embedded platform supported for the embedded-\/software library. The project was developed and tested using a M\+S\+P430\+F5529.

\subsection*{Usage}

The U\+A\+RT communication is configured to utilize the back-\/channel port at 460800 baud. A U\+SB to T\+T\+L/\+F\+T\+DI converter is recommended. On M\+S\+P430 processors it is highly recommended to N\+OT use the built-\/in Application U\+A\+RT due to slow speeds.

\subsection*{Pu\+T\+TY Configuration}

Any terminal with Serial communication support is suitable by this R\+E\+A\+D\+ME will discuss configuration using Pu\+T\+TY.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Set baud rate to 460800
\item In \char`\"{}\+Window\char`\"{} menu set columns and rows to appropiate size (game configured for 60 x 25 by default)
\item In \char`\"{}\+Window\char`\"{} -\/$>$ \char`\"{}\+Translation\char`\"{} menu set \char`\"{}\+Remote character set\char`\"{} to \char`\"{}\+C\+P866\char`\"{}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Running the game}

With the terminal open and the code running, type \char`\"{}\$game fly1 play\char`\"{} to start playing the game

\subsection*{Prerequistes for building code}

This project uses \href{https://github.com/muhlbaier/embedded-software}{\texttt{ embedded-\/software library}}. Please download and refer to library documentation to configure the project for your embedded platform.
